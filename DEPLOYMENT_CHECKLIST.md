- [x] Committed to GitHub main branch (commits: 3cf453c, 4a429f0, dc0cd47)

### 2. Local Environment
- [x] Updated OpenAI API key in `.env` file
- [x] `.env` file properly excluded from git (in .gitignore)
- [x] Local testing ready (restart dev server with `npm run dev`)

## ‚è≥ Pending Actions for Production Deployment

### 3. Vercel Environment Variables Setup

**CRITICAL:** You must set these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard before redeployment.

#### Steps:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Select your project: `architect-ai-platform`
3. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add/Update the following variables for **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key-starting-with-sk-proj->

REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key-starting-with-sk-proj->

REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your-google-maps-api-key>

REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your-openweather-api-key>

REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=<your-replicate-api-key-starting-with-r8_>
```

**Note:** Copy the actual API keys from your local `.env` file when setting these in Vercel.

5. Click **Save** for each variable

### 4. Trigger Redeployment

**Option A - Automatic (Recommended):**
- Vercel auto-deploys when you push to main branch
- Your latest commits should trigger auto-deployment
- Check Deployments tab: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments

**Option B - Manual Redeploy:**
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí **Redeploy**
4. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

## üìä Verification Steps

After deployment completes:

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- [ ] Vercel deployment shows "Ready" status
- [ ] No build errors in deployment logs
- [ ] Environment variables loaded correctly

### 2. Test Production Site
Go to: https://www.archiaisolution.pro

- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Location analysis works
- [ ] Portfolio upload works
- [ ] OpenAI integration works (no 401 errors in console)
- [ ] Image generation works (Replicate API)

### 3. Verify Performance Improvements
Open browser console and check for:

```
‚úÖ Floor plans generated in 40-60s (parallel execution)
‚úÖ Technical drawings generated in 30s (parallel execution, 6 drawings)
‚úÖ 3D views generated in 40-50s (parallel execution, 5 views)
```

**Expected Total Generation Time:** 60-90 seconds (down from 3-5 minutes!)

### 4. Monitor for Errors
Check browser console for:
- ‚ùå 401 errors ‚Üí OpenAI key not set correctly in Vercel
- ‚ùå CORS errors ‚Üí Check API proxy configuration
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution logs ‚Üí Performance optimizations working

## üîí Security Notes

- **NEVER commit API keys to GitHub**
- `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and should stay there
- API keys are only set in:
  - Local `.env` file (for development)
  - Vercel environment variables (for production)
- If keys are accidentally committed, immediately:
  1. Revoke the exposed keys in respective dashboards
  2. Generate new keys
  3. Update Vercel environment variables
  4. Remove keys from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner

## üìà Expected Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations
- Floor plans: 60-180s (sequential)
- Elevations/sections: 120-180s (sequential)
- 3D views: 150-250s (sequential)
- Construction docs: 180-330s (sequential)
- **Total: 3-5 minutes**

### After Optimizations
- Floor plans: 20-60s (parallel)
- Elevations/sections: 30s (parallel)
- 3D views: 30-50s (parallel)
- Construction docs: 30-90s (parallel)
- **Total: 60-90 seconds**

### Performance Gain
- **60-80% faster** overall
- **Improved user experience**
- **Same API costs** (same number of requests, just concurrent)

## üéØ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [x] All commits pushed to GitHub main branch
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel for all environments
- [ ] Production site deployed and accessible
- [ ] No 401 authentication errors
- [ ] Generation completes in 60-90 seconds
- [ ] Parallel execution logs visible in console
- [ ] All features working (location, portfolio, generation, export)

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Issue: 401 OpenAI Errors
**Solution:**
1. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in Vercel
2. Redeploy after setting variables
3. Check serverless function logs in Vercel

### Issue: Images Not Generating
**Solution:**
1. Check `REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY` in Vercel
2. Verify Replicate account has sufficient credits
3. Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue: Performance Not Improved
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check console for "parallel execution" logs
3. Verify latest deployment is active (check commit hash)

### Issue: Maps Not Loading
**Solution:**
1. Check `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in Vercel
2. Verify Google Maps API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Check for CORS errors in console
