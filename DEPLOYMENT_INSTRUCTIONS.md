## üîÑ Automatic Deployment (Vercel)

Your repository is configured with **Vercel GitHub integration**, which means:

### **Automatic Deployment Will Trigger**:
- ‚úÖ Vercel detects new commits to main branch
- ‚úÖ Automatically starts building your site
- ‚úÖ Deploys to: www.archiaisolution.pro

### **Check Deployment Status**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `architect-ai-platform`
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for latest deployment with commits: `5375841` and `f4a72f3`

**Typical Timeline**:
- Detection: ~30 seconds after push
- Build Time: ~2-3 minutes
- Total: ~3-4 minutes until live

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Configure OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)

**The 80% consistency enhancement requires OpenAI API key to work fully.**

### **Steps to Add API Key in Vercel**:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select project: `architect-ai-platform`

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**:
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar

3. **Add OpenAI API Keys**:

   **Variable 1**:
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `sk-proj-...your_openai_api_key...`
   - Environment: Select ALL (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

   **Variable 2**:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `sk-proj-...your_openai_api_key...` (same key)
   - Environment: Select ALL (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Verify Existing Keys** (Should already be there):
   - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` ‚úÖ
   - `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` ‚úÖ
   - `REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY` ‚úÖ
   - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` ‚úÖ

5. **Redeploy After Adding Keys**:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy" button
   - Wait ~2-3 minutes for rebuild

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### **Test 1: Verify Site is Live**
1. Visit: https://www.archiaisolution.pro
2. Should see updated site with no errors
3. Try generating a design

### **Test 2: Verify OpenAI API Key Works**
1. Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Start a new design with UK address
3. Go through all 8 steps
4. At Step 6 "Generate Designs", click "Generate AI Designs"
5. Watch console logs for:
   ```
   üß¨ STEP 4: Creating Comprehensive Design DNA for 80%+ Consistency
      Using OpenAI to generate ultra-detailed specifications...
   ‚úÖ Comprehensive Design DNA Created:
      Dimensions: 15.2m √ó 10.4m
      Floors: 2
      Primary Material: red clay brick
      Material Color: warm red-brown
      Roof: gable slate tiles
      Windows: casement - anthracite grey
      Color Palette: warm red-brown
      üéØ Consistency Rule: MUST USE: red clay brick (warm red-brown) for ALL exterior walls...
   ```

### **Test 3: Verify Consistency Enhancement**
After design generation completes:

1. **Check Elevations** (CRITICAL):
   - View: North Elevation
   - View: South Elevation
   - View: East Elevation
   - View: West Elevation
   - ‚úÖ **Verify**: ALL show SAME material color (should be brick, NOT yellow!)

2. **Check 3D Views**:
   - View: Exterior Front
   - View: Exterior Side
   - View: Axonometric
   - ‚úÖ **Verify**: ALL show SAME material color and texture

3. **Check Sections**:
   - View: Longitudinal Section
   - View: Cross Section (if available)
   - ‚úÖ **Verify**: Match DNA dimensions and materials

### **Expected Results**:
‚úÖ All elevations show consistent brick color (NO yellow!)
‚úÖ Axonometric matches other 3D views (NO yellow!)
‚úÖ All views use same materials and colors
‚úÖ Console shows DNA generation logs
‚úÖ Overall consistency: **80%+**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: OpenAI API Not Working**
**Symptoms**: Console shows "OpenAI API error, using enhanced fallback"
**Solution**:
1. Verify API key is added in Vercel (both variables)
2. Verify API key format: `sk-proj-...`
3. Check OpenAI account has credits
4. Redeploy after adding keys

**Note**: System will still work with fallback DNA, but OpenAI gives better results

### **Issue 2: Still Seeing Yellow Elevations**
**Symptoms**: Elevations showing yellow instead of brick
**Possible Causes**:
1. Old design cached - try new design
2. OpenAI API not configured - check console logs
3. Need to clear browser cache

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Generate completely new design
3. Verify DNA generation in console
4. Check that consistency rules appear in logs

### **Issue 3: Build Failed on Vercel**
**Symptoms**: Deployment shows "Build Error"
**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error
2. Verify all dependencies in package.json
3. Try redeploying
4. Contact if persistent
