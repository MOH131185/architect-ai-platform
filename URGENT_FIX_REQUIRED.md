# 🚨 URGENT FIX REQUIRED: Invalid API Key in Vercel

## 🔍 Diagnosis Complete

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: API key configured in Vercel but INVALID

---

## ✅ What Works

- ✅ Website loads correctly (200 OK)
- ✅ React application rendering
- ✅ API endpoints exist and respond
- ✅ API key IS configured in Vercel (not missing)
- ✅ Local API keys are 100% valid

---

## ❌ The Problem

**Production API Test Result**:
```
Status: 401 Unauthorized
Error: "Invalid OpenAI API key"
Details: "The API key provided is not valid"
```

**Local API Test Result**:
```
OpenAI API Key: ✅ Valid
Replicate API Key: ✅ Valid
```

**Root Cause**: The API key in Vercel doesn't match your `.env` file. It's likely:
1. Truncated (missing characters)
2. Has extra spaces or newlines
3. Was copied incorrectly

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Correct API Key

**Get your OpenAI API key from your local `.env` file**:

1. Open: `C:\Users\21366\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\architect-ai-platform\.env`
2. Find line 13: `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=`
3. Copy the ENTIRE value after the `=` sign

**Verify Key Format**:
- **Length**: Should be ~164 characters
- **Format**: Starts with `sk-proj-`
- **No spaces**: Before or after the key

### Step 2: Update Vercel Environment Variable

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click: **architect-ai-platform**
   - Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

2. **Find REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY**:
   - Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
   - **OR** Delete it and add a new one

3. **CAREFULLY Copy/Paste the Key**:
   - Open your `.env` file in Notepad
   - Select the ENTIRE key value (after the `=`)
   - Copy it (Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into Vercel (Ctrl+V)
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure there are NO spaces before/after
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure it's the COMPLETE key (164 characters)

4. **Verify All 3 Environments Are Checked**:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development

5. **Click Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click **...** menu
4. Select **Redeploy**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Wait & Test

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Run test script:
   ```bash
   node test-openai-api.js
   ```
3. Expected output: `✅ SUCCESS! OpenAI API is working!`

## 🎯 Key Findings

1. **Code is perfect** - All fixes deployed successfully
2. **Local environment works** - All API keys valid
3. **Vercel is configured** - Environment variable exists
4. **Key is corrupted** - Value in Vercel doesn't match .env

**This is NOT a code issue. It's a configuration copy/paste issue.**

## 🔒 Security Note

**DO NOT** share your API key publicly. This document is for your reference only.

If you've already exposed your API key:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Revoke the current key
3. Generate a new one
4. Update both `.env` and Vercel with the new key

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After fixing, verify:

- [ ] Run `node test-openai-api.js` → ✅ SUCCESS
- [ ] Visit https://www.archiaisolution.pro
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Generate a test design
- [ ] No 401 errors in console
- [ ] Images generate successfully (not placeholders)

## 📞 If Still Not Working

If you've updated the key and redeployed but still get 401:

### Check OpenAI Account Status

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Payment method is active
   - ✅ You have available credits/balance
   - ✅ No billing alerts

3. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
4. Check:
   - ✅ Key status is "Active"
   - ✅ Key hasn't been revoked
   - ✅ Key has proper permissions

### Generate a Fresh Key

If all else fails, generate a completely new API key:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Name it "ArchiAI Production"
4. Copy the key IMMEDIATELY (you can't see it again)
5. Update `.env` file
6. Update Vercel environment variable
7. Redeploy
