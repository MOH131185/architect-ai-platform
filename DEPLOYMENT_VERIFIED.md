## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **After Deployment Succeeds**:

1. **Verify Environment Variables** (CRITICAL):
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure all 5 keys are set (especially `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
   - Redeploy if you add variables

2. **Test Basic Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Go to https://www.archiaisolution.pro
   2. Enter address: "10 Downing Street, London"
   3. Check location intelligence report shows UK data
   4. Click through to portfolio upload
   5. Skip portfolio (test location-only first)
   6. Generate design
   7. Verify outputs appear
   ```

3. **Test UK Intelligence**:
   ```
   1. Try different UK cities:
      - "Baker Street, London"
      - "Piccadilly, Manchester"
      - "Royal Mile, Edinburgh"
   2. Verify UK-specific data appears:
      - Regional climate data
      - Sun path calculations
      - UK building regulations
      - Local architectural styles
   ```

4. **Test Portfolio Analysis**:
   ```
   1. Upload 5-10 architectural images
   2. Adjust material weight (0.0 - 1.0)
   3. Adjust characteristic weight (0.0 - 1.0)
   4. Generate design
   5. Check console (F12) for workflow logs
   6. Verify blended style appears in results
   ```

5. **Test Non-UK Location**:
   ```
   1. Enter international address (e.g., "Times Square, New York")
   2. Verify graceful fallback to global database
   3. Verify generation still works
   ```
