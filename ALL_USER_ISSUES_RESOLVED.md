## üéØ Summary

You reported 3 critical issues preventing proper use of the system. **ALL 3 ARE NOW FIXED**:

1. ‚úÖ **Detached house generating as 5+ story apartment building** - FIXED
2. ‚úÖ **Floor plans much larger than user-specified area** - FIXED
3. ‚úÖ **Axonometric showing completely different building from other 3D views** - FIXED
4. ‚úÖ **BONUS: Elevations/sections showing 5+ story apartment instead of 2-story house** - FIXED

---

## üì∏ What You Reported (Your Screenshots)

### **Issue 1**: Wrong Building Type
- **User Selected**: "Detached house"
- **Got**: 5+ story apartment building with massive floor plans
- **Floor Plans**: Showed huge multi-unit layout with 20+ rooms

### **Issue 2**: Wrong Floor Plan Size
- **User Requested**: ~200m¬≤ total area
- **Got**: Floor plans showing 500-1000m¬≤ with excessive rooms
- **Evidence**: Ground floor alone appeared 300-400m¬≤

### **Issue 3**: Axonometric Inconsistent
- **Exterior Front View**: Brick terraced house, traditional style
- **Exterior Side View**: Brick terraced house, traditional style
- **Axonometric**: Modern glass/white cube building - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

### **Issue 4**: Elevations/Sections Inconsistent (You Also Reported)
- **3D Views**: 2-story brick house with residential character
- **Elevations (N, S, E, W)**: 5-story classical white stone apartment building
- **Sections**: 5-story classical building - NOT matching 2-story brick house

## üîß Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: Enforce Single-Family House Constraints** (Commit cb0ed3d)
**File**: `src/services/replicateService.js` (lines 455-490)

**Problem**: `calculateFloorCount()` ignored building type, only used area
- Example: 600m¬≤ house ‚Üí `Math.ceil(600/200) = 3` floors
- Example: 1000m¬≤ house ‚Üí `Math.ceil(1000/200) = 5` floors ‚ùå Creates apartment building!

**Solution**: Detect single-family houses and enforce MAX 2 floors

```javascript
const isSingleFamilyHouse =
  buildingType.includes('house') ||
  buildingType.includes('villa') ||
  buildingType.includes('detached') ||
  buildingType.includes('single-family') ||
  buildingType.includes('townhouse');

if (isSingleFamilyHouse) {
  if (area < 150) return 1;   // Small house
  if (area < 400) return 2;   // Medium house
  if (buildingType.includes('villa') && area >= 400) return 3;  // Large villa
  return 2;  // All other houses: MAX 2 floors (prevents apartment buildings!)
}
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ 200m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (100m¬≤ per floor)
- ‚úÖ 500m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (250m¬≤ per floor) NOT 3 floors
- ‚úÖ 1000m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (500m¬≤ per floor) NOT 5 floors
- ‚úÖ Apartments/offices still allow 3-5+ floors

---

### **Fix 2: Clarify Floor Plan Area Per Floor** (Commit cb0ed3d)
**File**: `src/services/replicateService.js` (lines 838-878)

**Problem**: Prompt ambiguity - "200m¬≤ total area" interpreted as "200m¬≤ PER FLOOR"

**Solution**: Calculate and specify footprint per floor explicitly

```javascript
const totalArea = unifiedDesc.floorArea;         // 200m¬≤
const floorCount = unifiedDesc.floorCount;       // 2 floors
const footprintArea = Math.round(totalArea / floorCount);  // 100m¬≤ per floor

prompt: `BUILDING FOOTPRINT ${footprintArea}m¬≤ THIS FLOOR ONLY
(total building ${totalArea}m¬≤ distributed across ${floorCount} floors)`
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ 200m¬≤ house with 2 floors ‚Üí generates 100m¬≤ floor plan per floor
- ‚úÖ 400m¬≤ house with 2 floors ‚Üí generates 200m¬≤ floor plan per floor
- ‚úÖ AI clearly understands EXACT footprint size

---

### **Fix 3: Strengthen Axonometric Material Consistency** (Commit cb0ed3d)
**File**: `src/services/replicateService.js` (lines 670-710)

**Problem**: Generic material descriptions + "technical illustration" wording triggered modern style

**Before**:
```javascript
const dnaMaterials = buildingDNAAxo.materials?.exterior || unifiedDesc.materials;
// Result: Generic "brick and glass" ‚Üí AI interprets as modern style
```

**After**:
```javascript
const materialPrimaryAxo = dnaMaterialsObj.primary || unifiedDesc.materials;  // "red clay brick"
const materialColorAxo = dnaMaterialsObj.color || 'natural brick red-brown';  // SPECIFIC COLOR
const materialTextureAxo = dnaMaterialsObj.texture || 'textured brick with mortar joints';  // TEXTURE
const materialFullAxo = `${materialPrimaryAxo} (${materialColorAxo}) with ${materialTextureAxo}`;

prompt: `CRITICAL MATERIAL CONSISTENCY FIRST: Building constructed with ${materialFullAxo},
IDENTICAL materials and colors to Exterior Front and Side views...
Photorealistic architectural rendering with EXACT ${materialPrimaryAxo} (${materialColorAxo})
texture matching other 3D visualizations...`

negativePrompt: "modern glass building, white cube building, contemporary minimalist cube,
technical diagram, simplified CAD wireframe, different materials from other views"
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Axonometric extracts exact color: "warm red-brown" not just "brick"
- ‚úÖ Axonometric extracts exact texture: "textured brick with mortar joints"
- ‚úÖ Material specification comes FIRST in prompt (highest priority)
- ‚úÖ Changed "technical illustration" ‚Üí "realistic architectural visualization"
- ‚úÖ Strong negative prompts prevent modern glass/white cube

---

### **Fix 4: Enforce Correct Floor Count in Elevations & Sections** (Commit 0294856)
**Files**:
- `src/services/replicateService.js` (lines 821-891) - `buildElevationParameters()`
- `src/services/replicateService.js` (lines 897-1036) - `buildSectionParameters()`

**Problem**: "Professional CAD architectural elevation" triggered classical 5-story apartment style

**Solution**: Detect house type and explicitly enforce correct floor count

```javascript
// Detect single-family houses
const buildingTypeLC = (unifiedDesc.buildingProgram || '').toLowerCase();
const isHouse = buildingTypeLC.includes('house') ||
                buildingTypeLC.includes('villa') ||
                buildingTypeLC.includes('detached');

// Building type emphasis
const buildingTypeEmphasis = isHouse
  ? `SINGLE-FAMILY ${unifiedDesc.floorCount}-STORY ${unifiedDesc.buildingProgram.toUpperCase()} NOT APARTMENT BUILDING`
  : unifiedDesc.buildingType;

prompt: `...technical blueprint of ${buildingTypeEmphasis},
CRITICAL: THIS IS A ${unifiedDesc.floorCount}-FLOOR RESIDENTIAL HOUSE NOT A TALL BUILDING,
...EXACTLY ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floor levels ONLY (ground + first floor)
stacked vertically...
elevation level markers at EXACTLY ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floor levels only...
matching the brick house from 3D photorealistic views...
unified consistent architectural design for ${unifiedDesc.floorCount}-story house NOT apartment building`

negativePrompt: "apartment building with 5+ floors, multi-story apartment complex, high-rise building,
too many floors, wrong number of floors, classical palace facade, ornate classical details, wrong building scale"
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Elevations show EXACTLY 2 floors matching DNA specification
- ‚úÖ Sections show EXACTLY 2 floors matching DNA specification
- ‚úÖ No more 5+ story apartment building technical drawings
- ‚úÖ Technical drawings match the 2-story brick house from 3D views
