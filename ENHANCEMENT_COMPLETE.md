## üéØ User Experience

### **Without Portfolio**:
1. Enter UK address ‚Üí Automatic UK intelligence
2. View climate, sun path, wind, materials, regulations
3. Generate design ‚Üí Location-based contemporary style
4. All outputs use UK-appropriate materials and regulations

### **With Portfolio** (5-10 images):
1. Enter UK address ‚Üí Automatic UK intelligence
2. Upload portfolio images ‚Üí GPT-4 Vision analysis
3. Adjust material weight (0.0 = all local, 1.0 = all portfolio)
4. Adjust characteristic weight (0.0 = all local, 1.0 = all portfolio)
5. Generate design ‚Üí Intelligently blended style
6. All outputs reflect blended style with perfect consistency

### **Non-UK Location**:
1. Enter international address ‚Üí Global database
2. Upload portfolio (optional) ‚Üí GPT-4 Vision analysis
3. Generate design ‚Üí Context-based or portfolio-based style
4. All outputs use appropriate materials for location

## üîç Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separate Material and Characteristic Weights**:
   - Allows fine-grained control (e.g., 70% portfolio materials but 30% portfolio characteristics)
   - Provides more flexibility than single blend weight
   - Better represents real architectural design decisions

2. **UK Database + Live APIs**:
   - Static database for comprehensive regional knowledge
   - Live APIs (OpenWeather) for real-time climate data
   - Best of both worlds: rich context + current conditions

3. **GPT-4o for Vision**:
   - Uses GPT-4o (not gpt-4-vision-preview) for portfolio analysis
   - Supports up to 10 images simultaneously
   - JSON-structured response with fallback text parsing

4. **Fallback Strategy**:
   - Location-based style if no portfolio provided
   - Context-based style if non-UK location with no portfolio
   - Graceful degradation ensures workflow never fails

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing extraction logic works with new result structure
   - Old `aiIntegrationService` still available as fallback
   - No breaking changes to frontend components

---

## üìù Next Steps

### **Immediate**:
1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy to production (auto-deploy via GitHub push)
3. Test complete workflow with UK address + portfolio images

### **Future Enhancements**:
1. Implement PDF.js for PDF portfolio processing
2. Add more UK cities (Liverpool, Glasgow, Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle)
3. Expand to other countries (US, EU, Asia)
4. Add portfolio style evolution tracking
5. Implement portfolio similarity scoring
6. Add climate adaptation recommendations for each design
