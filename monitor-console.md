## 🔍 What to Check in Browser Console

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Visit: https://www.archiaisolution.pro
2. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Click **Console** tab

### **Step 2: Clear Old Errors**
1. Click the 🚫 icon (Clear console)
2. This removes old 401 errors from before the fix

### **Step 3: Monitor During Generation**

When you click "Generate AI Designs", watch for these messages:

#### ✅ **Expected SUCCESS Messages**:
```
🎨 Starting integrated AI design generation with: Object
🎲 Project seed for consistent outputs: [number]
📍 Step 1: Analyzing location and architectural context...
✅ Location analysis complete
🎨 Step 2: Analyzing portfolio style (if provided)...
✅ Portfolio style detection complete
🎨 Step 3: Blending styles...
✅ Blended style created
🧠 Step 4: Generating OpenAI design reasoning...
✅ Design reasoning generated
🏗️ Step 5: Generating multi-level floor plans...
✅ Floor plans generated
🏗️ Step 6: Generating elevations and sections...
✅ Technical drawings generated
🏗️ Step 7: Generating 3D photorealistic views...
✅ 3D views generated
🔍 Step 10: Validating output consistency...
✅ Consistency validation complete: Score [XX]%
```

#### ❌ **Errors to Watch For**:

**1. Network Errors**:
- Look for red text in console
- Check Network tab for failed requests (red status codes)

**2. API Rate Limiting**:
```
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```
- **Cause**: Too many requests too quickly
- **Fix**: Wait 1 minute and try again

**3. Replicate Timeout**:
```
Warning: Replicate generation taking longer than expected
```
- **Normal**: Image generation can take 30-60 seconds
- **Action**: Wait patiently

**4. Billing Issues**:
```
Error: 402 Payment Required
```
- **Cause**: Insufficient credits
- **Fix**: Check OpenAI/Replicate account billing

**5. Invalid Input**:
```
Error: Invalid building program
Error: Missing location data
```
- **Cause**: Form validation issue
- **Fix**: Ensure all required fields are filled

## 🎯 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No floor plan found, using placeholder"

**Cause**: Replicate generation failed or timed out
**Check**:
1. Look for Replicate API errors in console
2. Check Network tab → Filter by "replicate"
3. Look for 401 or 500 errors

**Solutions**:
- If 401: Replicate API key may be invalid (unlikely if OpenAI works)
- If timeout: Replicate servers may be slow (wait and retry)
- If 500: Replicate service issue (check status.replicate.com)

### Issue: "Portfolio style detection error"

**Cause**: OpenAI Vision API issue with uploaded images
**Check**:
1. Console should show specific error message
2. Check if images uploaded successfully

**Solutions**:
- Try skipping portfolio upload (use "Skip Portfolio" option)
- Ensure images are valid JPG/PNG format
- Check image file size (should be < 10MB each)

### Issue: "Design generation failed"

**Cause**: Multiple possible issues
**Check Console For**:
1. First error message (will indicate which step failed)
2. Network errors (red text)
3. API response errors

**Solutions**:
- Check specific error message
- Verify all API keys are configured
- Check OpenAI/Replicate account status
- Try again (temporary service issues)

## 🔧 Developer Tools Tips

### Network Tab:
1. Click **Network** tab
2. Filter by **Fetch/XHR**
3. Look for:
   - `/api/openai-chat` → Should be 200 ✅
   - `/api/replicate-predictions` → Should be 200 ✅
   - `/api/replicate-status` → Should be 200 ✅

### Console Tab:
1. Filter by **Errors** (red ❌ icon)
2. Check for any 4xx or 5xx errors
3. Warnings (yellow ⚠️) are usually okay

### Application Tab:
1. Check **Local Storage** → No sensitive data exposed
2. Check **Session Storage** → Generation state saved correctly
