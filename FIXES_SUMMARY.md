# Production Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. 3D Map View Not Showing
**Problem:** Google Maps were not displaying on the Intelligence Report page.

**Root Cause:** The Google Maps Wrapper component was commented out in `src/ArchitectAIEnhanced.js` (lines 1697 and 1748).

**Solution:** Uncommented the `<Wrapper>` component to enable 3D map rendering.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/ArchitectAIEnhanced.js` - Lines 1697, 1748

---

### 2. AI Generation Taking Too Long / Timing Out
**Problem:** AI design generation never completes, hangs indefinitely.

**Root Causes:**
1. Vercel Hobby plan has 10-second timeout (Pro: 60s, Enterprise: 900s)
2. `generateCompleteDesign()` takes 60-90 seconds (too long for default timeout)
3. No `vercel.json` configuration file to set custom timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. Created `vercel.json` with 60-second `maxDuration` for API functions
2. Switched from `generateCompleteDesign()` to `quickDesign()` mode
3. Added proper API route rewrites and CORS headers

**Quick Design Mode** (~25-40 seconds):
- OpenAI design reasoning (1 call)
- Single Replicate visualization (exterior view)
- Fits within 60-second Pro plan timeout

**Complete Design Mode** (~60-90 seconds):
- OpenAI reasoning + alternatives + feasibility (5+ calls)
- Multiple Replicate visualizations (3-5 images)
- Requires Enterprise plan or code splitting

**Files Changed:**
- `vercel.json` - New file with configuration
- `src/ArchitectAIEnhanced.js` - Line 627: `quickDesign()` instead of `generateCompleteDesign()`

---

## Files Modified

### New Files:
1. `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
2. `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment instructions
3. `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
1. `src/ArchitectAIEnhanced.js`
   - Line 1697: Uncommented `<Wrapper>` opening tag
   - Line 1748: Uncommented `</Wrapper>` closing tag
   - Line 627: Changed to `quickDesign()`

2. `CLAUDE.md`
   - Updated architecture documentation
   - Removed maintenance mode references
   - Added current AI integration details

---

## Deployment Steps Required

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variables

You **MUST** add these 4 environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `architect-ai-platform`
3. Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add each variable (select **all 3 environments**):

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

5. **Redeploy** after adding variables

### Automatic Redeployment

Your GitHub push will trigger automatic redeployment:
- Vercel will detect the new commit
- Build process starts automatically
- New deployment ready in ~2-3 minutes
- Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Deployments

---

## Vercel Plan Requirements

### Hobby Plan (Free):
- ❌ Function timeout: 10 seconds (NOT ENOUGH)
- ❌ AI generation will timeout
- ⚠️ Need to upgrade to Pro

### Pro Plan ($20/month):
- ✅ Function timeout: 60 seconds
- ✅ Quick design mode works
- ✅ Recommended for production

### Enterprise Plan:
- ✅ Function timeout: 900 seconds
- ✅ Complete design mode works
- ✅ Best for full feature set

**Current Configuration:** Optimized for **Pro Plan** (60-second timeout)

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ 3D map section blank/empty
- ❌ AI generation loads forever
- ❌ Browser shows timeout or network errors
- ❌ No results displayed

### After Fixes:
- ✅ 3D map shows satellite imagery
- ✅ AI generation completes in ~30 seconds
- ✅ Results page displays immediately after generation
- ✅ All features functional

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Vercel Logs:
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to: Deployments → [Latest Deployment]
4. Click: "View Function Logs"
5. Look for errors or timeouts
```

### Check Browser Console:
```
1. Open site: https://www.archiaisolution.pro
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to: Console tab
4. Look for red error messages
5. Check Network tab for failed requests
```

### Common Errors:

**"Failed to fetch"**
- API keys not set in Vercel
- Check environment variables

**"Timeout exceeded"**
- Function took >60 seconds
- Verify you're on Pro plan
- Check `vercel.json` is deployed

**"Map is not defined"**
- Google Maps API key missing
- Maps JavaScript API not enabled
- Check Wrapper component is active

---

## Build Warnings (Normal)

These warnings during deployment are **NORMAL** and can be ignored:

```
npm warn deprecated workbox-*
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3
npm warn deprecated eslint@8.57.1
Warning: Node.js functions are compiled from ESM to CommonJS
```

These come from `react-scripts` dependencies and won't affect functionality.

---

## API Cost Estimates

### Per Design Generation (Quick Mode):
- OpenAI GPT-4: ~$0.05
- Replicate SDXL: ~$0.10
- **Total: ~$0.15**

### Monthly Estimates (100 designs):
- AI Costs: ~$15
- Vercel Pro Plan: $20
- **Total: ~$35/month**

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback to previous commit:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Push to trigger redeployment
git push origin main
```

Or manually redeploy previous version in Vercel:
1. Go to: Deployments
2. Find previous working deployment
3. Click: "⋯" menu → "Promote to Production"

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ✅ 3D map visible on Intelligence Report
- ✅ AI generation completes <60 seconds
- ✅ Results page shows AI-generated content
- ✅ All file exports work
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Mobile responsive

---

## Next Actions

1. **Add environment variables in Vercel** (CRITICAL)
2. **Wait for automatic redeployment** (~3 minutes)
3. **Test the live site** using checklist above
4. **Monitor first few AI generations** for errors
5. **Check API costs** in OpenAI/Replicate dashboards
6. **Consider upgrading to Pro plan** if on Hobby
