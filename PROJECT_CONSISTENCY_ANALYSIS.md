---

## 🎯 PROJECT WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Complete Generation Pipeline:

```
1. USER INPUT
   ├─ Location (Google Maps geocoding)
   ├─ Weather/Climate (OpenWeather API)
   ├─ Program (rooms, areas, floors)
   └─ Portfolio Images (optional)

2. OPENAI REASONING (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)
   ├─ Location Analysis → Recommended styles, materials
   ├─ Portfolio Detection → Extract user's style preferences
   ├─ Style Blending → Merge local + portfolio (weighted)
   └─ Design Reasoning → Creates UNIFIED architectural framework
       ├─ Design Philosophy
       ├─ Materials (extracted and applied to ALL views)
       ├─ Spatial Organization
       ├─ Environmental Features
       └─ Unified Architectural Prompt (injected into ALL generations)

3. REPLICATE IMAGE GENERATION (Uses OpenAI guidance)
   ├─ 2D Floor Plans (ground, upper, roof) → Use unified description
   ├─ Technical Drawings (4 elevations, 2 sections) → Use unified description
   ├─ 3D Views (front, side, interior, axonometric, perspective) → Use unified description
   ├─ Construction Docs (details, structural, MEP) → Use unified description
   └─ ALL use same projectSeed + view-specific offsets

4. BIM GENERATION (Optional)
   ├─ Parametric model from floor plans
   └─ Geometrically-accurate axonometric view

5. FINAL OUTPUT
   └─ Complete architectural package with consistent design
```

## ✅ CONSISTENCY MECHANISMS IN PLACE

### 1. **Unified Project Seed**
**File:** `aiIntegrationService.js:847-849`

```javascript
const projectSeed = projectContext.projectSeed || Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000);
enhancedContext.seed = projectSeed;
console.log('🎲 Using unified seed:', projectSeed);
```

**How it ensures consistency:**
- Single seed generated for entire project
- All views use same base seed + offset
- Prevents random variation between generations

**Seed Offsets (replicateService.js:318-327):**
```javascript
const seedOffsets = {
  'exterior_front': 0,
  'exterior_side': 100,
  'interior': 200,
  'axonometric': 300,
  'perspective': 400,
  'site_plan': 500
};
```

---

### 2. **Unified Architectural Prompt from OpenAI**
**File:** `aiIntegrationService.js:459-482`

```javascript
createUnifiedArchitecturalPrompt(reasoning) {
  const materials = this.extractMaterialsFromReasoning(reasoning);
  const philosophy = reasoning.designPhilosophy;
  const spatial = reasoning.spatialOrganization;
  const environmental = this.extractEnvironmentalFeatures(reasoning);

  return `
    Architectural design following this EXACT specification:
    PHILOSOPHY: ${philosophy}
    MATERIALS: ${materials} facade and construction
    SPATIAL: ${spatial}
    ENVIRONMENTAL: ${environmental}
    CONSISTENCY: All views must show the SAME building
  `;
}
```

**How it ensures consistency:**
- OpenAI analyzes project and creates single design specification
- This specification is INJECTED into EVERY Replicate generation
- Floor plans, elevations, 3D views all reference same text

---

### 3. **Reasoning-Enhanced Context**
**File:** `aiIntegrationService.js:318-378`

```javascript
createReasoningEnhancedContext(projectContext, reasoning) {
  return {
    ...projectContext,
    // Override with reasoning-derived parameters
    materials: extractedParams.materials,
    architecturalStyle: this.extractArchitecturalStyle(reasoning, projectContext),
    designPhilosophy: extractedParams.designPhilosophy,
    spatialOrganization: extractedParams.spatialOrganization,

    // CRITICAL: Unified prompt for ALL generations
    unifiedArchitecturalPrompt: extractedParams.unifiedArchitecturalPrompt,
    isReasoningEnhanced: true,
    fullReasoning: reasoning
  };
}
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Floor plans (line 861)
- ✅ Elevations & sections (line 872)
- ✅ 3D views (line 888)
- ✅ Construction docs (line 1202)

---

### 4. **Unified Building Description**
**File:** `replicateService.js:29-68`

```javascript
createUnifiedBuildingDescription(projectContext) {
  const floorCount = this.calculateFloorCount(projectContext);
  const levels = floorCount === 1 ? 'single-story' : `${floorCount}-story`;

  return {
    buildingType: `${levels} ${architecturalStyle} ${buildingProgram}`,
    fullDescription: `${levels} ${architecturalStyle} ${buildingProgram} with ${entranceDesc}`,
    materials: materials,
    floorCount: floorCount,
    entranceDirection: entranceDirection,
    features: this.getBuildingFeatures(...)
  };
}
```

**How it ensures consistency:**
- Single source of truth for building characteristics
- All views reference same: style, materials, floor count, entrance
- Used by ALL view generation functions

---

### 5. **Project Details Extraction**
**File:** `replicateService.js:74-126`

```javascript
extractProjectDetails(projectContext) {
  return {
    areaDetail: " (150m² total area)",
    programDetail: "containing 3 bedrooms (15m², 12m², 10m²)...",
    spacesDetail: " with 7 distinct spaces",
    interiorDetail: "featuring 3 bedrooms...",
    mainSpace: "living room"
  };
}
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Floor plan prompts → Shows actual room program
- ✅ 3D exterior prompts → Mentions total area and room count
- ✅ 3D interior prompts → Shows specific main space

---

### 6. **View-Specific Prompts (All Reference Unified Description)**

**Exterior Front (line 631-639):**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}Professional 3D visualization of ${entranceDir}-facing
front view of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}${projectDetails.areaDetail},
${projectDetails.programDetail}, ${materials} facade...`
```

**Exterior Side (line 643-651):**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}Professional 3D visualization showing ${sideDir} side
view of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}${projectDetails.areaDetail},
${projectDetails.programDetail}...`
```

**Interior (line 667):**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}INTERIOR ONLY: Professional 3D interior visualization,
inside view of ${interiorSpace} of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}
${projectDetails.areaDetail}, ${projectDetails.interiorDetail}...`
```

**Axonometric (line 696):**
```javascript
prompt: `Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric view of the
SAME ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription} matching the ${unifiedDesc.architecturalStyle}
style design from floor plans and elevations...`
```

**Perspective (line 707):**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}Wide angle aerial perspective rendering of COMPLETE
${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}${projectDetails.areaDetail},
${projectDetails.programDetail}...`
```

**ALL prompts:**
- Reference `unifiedDesc.fullDescription` (same building type)
- Reference `projectDetails` (same room program)
- Reference `materials` from reasoning
- Include `reasoningPrefix` (OpenAI's unified architectural prompt)

---

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fix #1: Axonometric Always Generated
**File:** `aiIntegrationService.js:890`

**Before:**
```javascript
['exterior_front', 'exterior_side', 'interior', 'perspective']
// Axonometric missing!
```

**After:**
```javascript
['exterior_front', 'exterior_side', 'interior', 'axonometric', 'perspective']
// ✅ Axonometric included
```

---

### Fix #2: Seed Offsets Prevent Identical Views
**File:** `replicateService.js:318-337`

**Before:**
```javascript
params.seed = projectSeed; // All views use same seed → identical!
```

**After:**
```javascript
const seedOffset = seedOffsets[viewType] || 0;
params.seed = projectSeed + seedOffset; // Each view gets unique offset
```

**Result:**
- Front view: seed + 0
- Side view: seed + 100 (different angle)
- Interior: seed + 200 (different view type)
- Axonometric: seed + 300 (technical view)
- Perspective: seed + 400 (artistic view)

---

### Fix #3: Interior Shows Interior (Not Exterior)
**File:** `replicateService.js:667-672`

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}INTERIOR ONLY: Professional 3D architectural interior
visualization, inside view of ${interiorSpace}...`

negativePrompt: "exterior, outside, facade, building exterior, outdoor, landscape,
trees, street, sky visible, exterior walls, building from outside, aerial view,
elevation, front view, site plan, technical drawing, blueprint"
```

**Result:**
- "INTERIOR ONLY:" prefix forces interior generation
- Comprehensive negative prompt excludes all exterior elements

---

### Fix #4: Perspective Shows Full Building
**File:** `replicateService.js:707`

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```javascript
prompt: `${reasoningPrefix}Wide angle aerial perspective rendering of COMPLETE
${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}, dramatic 3D perspective view from distance showing
entire building with ${entranceDir}-facing entrance, FULL BUILDING IN FRAME with
surrounding context... bird's eye perspective angle capturing entire structure,
distant viewpoint`
```

**Result:**
- "Wide angle aerial perspective" → Full building view
- "from distance" → Not zoomed in
- "FULL BUILDING IN FRAME" → Complete structure visible

## 📊 DATA FLOW FOR CONSISTENCY

### Step-by-Step Consistency Enforcement:

```
1. USER ENTERS PROJECT DETAILS
   └─> projectContext { location, program, materials, area }

2. OPENAI ANALYZES & CREATES FRAMEWORK
   └─> reasoning { philosophy, materials, spatial, environmental }
       └─> unifiedArchitecturalPrompt (text description)

3. CREATE REASONING-ENHANCED CONTEXT
   └─> reasoningEnhancedContext {
         ...projectContext,
         materials: <from reasoning>,
         unifiedArchitecturalPrompt: <from reasoning>,
         isReasoningEnhanced: true
       }

4. REPLICATE GENERATES ALL VIEWS
   Floor Plans:
   ├─> Use reasoningEnhancedContext
   ├─> createUnifiedBuildingDescription(context)
   ├─> extractProjectDetails(context)
   └─> Prompt includes: unified description + project details

   Elevations:
   ├─> Use reasoningEnhancedContext
   ├─> Same unified description
   └─> Same project seed

   3D Views (Front, Side, Interior, Axonometric, Perspective):
   ├─> Use reasoningEnhancedContext
   ├─> Each references unifiedDesc.fullDescription
   ├─> Each includes projectDetails (area, rooms)
   ├─> Each prefixed with reasoningPrefix (OpenAI guidance)
   └─> Each uses projectSeed + unique offset

5. RESULT: ALL VIEWS DESCRIBE SAME BUILDING
   ✅ Same materials (from OpenAI reasoning)
   ✅ Same style (from blended local + portfolio)
   ✅ Same floor count (from unified description)
   ✅ Same room program (from project details)
   ✅ Same design philosophy (from reasoning prefix)
```

- Same materials as front ✅
- Same floor count as front ✅

**3D Interior:**
- Shows interior space (not exterior) ✅
- Shows room from program ✅
- Same style as exterior ✅

**Axonometric:**
- Isometric 45-degree view ✅
- Shows complete building ✅
- Matches floor plan footprint ✅

**Perspective:**
- Shows full building from distance ✅
- Same materials as other views ✅
- Bird's eye angle ✅

#### ✅ 3. Verify Seed Consistency

Check console for seed logging:
```
🎲 Generating exterior_front with seed: 123456 (base: 123456 + offset: 0)
🎲 Generating exterior_side with seed: 123556 (base: 123456 + offset: 100)
🎲 Generating interior with seed: 123656 (base: 123456 + offset: 200)
🎲 Generating axonometric with seed: 123756 (base: 123456 + offset: 300)
🎲 Generating perspective with seed: 123856 (base: 123456 + offset: 400)
```

**All should use same base seed** ✅

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **Vercel Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**

**Must be configured for OpenAI reasoning to work:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Also required:**
```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your key>
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your key>
REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=<your key>
REPLICATE_API_KEY=<your key> (without REACT_APP_ prefix)
```

### 2. **Frontend Project Context**

**User must provide:**
- Location (address)
- Building program (e.g., "house", "office")
- Floor area (m²)
- Room program (bedrooms, bathrooms, living room, etc.)
- Optional: Portfolio images for style detection

---

## 🚨 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### 1. **OpenAI API Required for Full Consistency**
- Without OpenAI, fallback reasoning is generic
- Consistency is reduced to seed + unified description only
- **Fix:** Configure OPENAI_API_KEY in Vercel (see OPENAI_FIX_REQUIRED.md)

### 2. **AI Generation Variability**
- Even with same seed + prompt, SDXL has slight variation
- This is normal AI behavior, not a bug
- Seed offsets ensure variety while maintaining consistency

### 3. **ControlNet Not Used for 3D Views**
- Floor plans do NOT constrain 3D views (by design)
- 3D views need artistic freedom for photorealistic perspective
- Consistency maintained through prompts, not geometric constraints

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: 2D and 3D don't match

**Check:**
1. Is OpenAI API key configured in Vercel? (see OPENAI_FIX_REQUIRED.md)
2. Are there 401 errors in console?
3. Does reasoning show "isFallback: true"?

**Fix:** Configure OPENAI_API_KEY in Vercel and redeploy

### Issue: Exterior views are identical

**Check:**
1. Are seed offsets being applied?
2. Check console for seed logging

**Should see:**
```
🎲 Generating exterior_front with seed: X (base: X + offset: 0)
🎲 Generating exterior_side with seed: X+100 (base: X + offset: 100)
```

**Fix:** Already implemented in replicateService.js:333-337

### Issue: Interior shows exterior

**Check:**
1. Does prompt include "INTERIOR ONLY:"?
2. Is negative prompt comprehensive?

**Fix:** Already implemented in replicateService.js:667-672

### Issue: Axonometric missing

**Check:**
1. Is axonometric in view list?
2. Check aiIntegrationService.js:890

**Should see:**
```javascript
['exterior_front', 'exterior_side', 'interior', 'axonometric', 'perspective']
```

**Fix:** Already implemented in aiIntegrationService.js:890
