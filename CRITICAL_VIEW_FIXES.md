# Critical View Generation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **2D Floor Plans Showing 3D Views**
**Problem**: Floor plan sections were displaying 3D exterior renderings instead of 2D architectural plans.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient negative prompts and unclear positive prompts for 2D floor plans.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced floor plan prompts with "STRICTLY 2D FLOOR PLAN ONLY" prefix
- Added comprehensive negative prompts to prevent 3D renderings
- Specified "FLOOR PLAN VIEW ONLY, NO EXTERIOR VIEWS, NO 3D RENDERINGS"

**Files Modified**: `src/services/replicateService.js` - `buildFloorPlanParameters()`

### 2. **Interior Views Showing Exterior Buildings**
**Problem**: "Interior - Main Space" was displaying exterior building views instead of interior spaces.

**Root Cause**: Weak negative prompts allowing exterior elements to appear in interior views.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced interior view prompts with "INTERIOR VIEW ONLY, NO EXTERIOR ELEMENTS"
- Strengthened negative prompts to exclude all exterior elements
- Added specific exclusions for "3D exterior view, building facade, outdoor environment"

**Files Modified**: `src/services/replicateService.js` - `buildViewParameters()` for interior case

### 3. **Technical Drawings Showing 3D Renderings**
**Problem**: Elevations and sections were displaying 3D renderings instead of 2D technical drawings.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient specification for 2D orthographic projections in prompts.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced elevation prompts with "STRICTLY 2D ELEVATION DRAWING" prefix
- Enhanced section prompts with "STRICTLY 2D SECTION DRAWING" prefix
- Added comprehensive negative prompts to prevent 3D renderings
- Specified "ELEVATION/SECTION VIEW ONLY, NO 3D RENDERINGS, NO PERSPECTIVE VIEWS"

**Files Modified**: `src/services/replicateService.js` - `buildElevationParameters()` and `buildSectionParameters()`

### 4. **Construction Documentation Showing 3D Views**
**Problem**: Construction details, structural plans, and MEP plans were showing 3D renderings instead of 2D technical drawings.

**Root Cause**: Similar to technical drawings - insufficient 2D specification in prompts.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced construction detail prompts with "STRICTLY 2D CONSTRUCTION DETAIL" prefix
- Enhanced structural plan prompts with "STRICTLY 2D STRUCTURAL PLAN" prefix
- Enhanced MEP plan prompts with "STRICTLY 2D MEP PLAN" prefix
- Added comprehensive negative prompts for all construction documentation types

**Files Modified**: `src/services/replicateService.js` - `buildDetailParameters()`, `buildStructuralPlanParameters()`, `buildMEPPlanParameters()`

### 5. **Inconsistent Building Styles Across Views**
**Problem**: Different views were showing different buildings with different architectural styles.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent prompts and lack of unified architectural framework.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced unified architectural prompt with "CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT"
- Added "SAME PROJECT, SAME BUILDING, SAME DESIGN" to all prompts
- Strengthened consistency requirements in `createUnifiedArchitecturalPrompt()`

**Files Modified**: `src/services/aiIntegrationService.js` - `createUnifiedArchitecturalPrompt()`

## Key Changes Summary

### Enhanced Prompts
All generation functions now include:
- **Clear view type specification** (e.g., "STRICTLY 2D FLOOR PLAN ONLY")
- **Comprehensive negative prompts** to prevent unwanted view types
- **Consistency requirements** to ensure same building across all views

### Negative Prompt Strategy
Each view type now has specific negative prompts that exclude:
- 3D renderings and perspective views
- Wrong view types (e.g., exterior elements in interior views)
- Artistic/decorative elements in technical drawings
- Inconsistent architectural styles

### Consistency Framework
- All views now use the same unified architectural prompt
- Master Design Specification is injected into all prompts
- Project seed is consistently applied across all generations
- Building specifications are enforced across all view types

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the website should generate:

1. **Proper 2D Floor Plans**: Top-down orthographic projections with dimensions
2. **Actual Interior Views**: Interior spaces showing furniture and interior design
3. **2D Technical Drawings**: Elevations and sections as proper architectural drawings
4. **Consistent Building Design**: All views showing the same building with consistent materials and style
5. **Proper Construction Documentation**: 2D technical drawings for structural and MEP plans

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Floor Plans**: Verify ground floor and upper floor show 2D plans, not 3D views
2. **Test Interior Views**: Verify "Interior - Main Space" shows actual interior spaces
3. **Test Technical Drawings**: Verify elevations and sections are 2D technical drawings
4. **Test Consistency**: Verify all views show the same building with consistent style
5. **Test Construction Docs**: Verify structural and MEP plans are 2D technical drawings

## Files Modified

- `src/services/replicateService.js` - Enhanced all generation functions
- `src/services/aiIntegrationService.js` - Enhanced consistency framework
