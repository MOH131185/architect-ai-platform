# Critical Fixes Needed

## Issue 1: OpenAI API Key Not Being Used ❌

### **Problem**:
The OpenAI API key is not being read in production because it's not set in Vercel environment variables.

### **Evidence**:
- Portfolio analysis is using fallback data (not real GPT-4 Vision)
- Console shows: "Portfolio analysis will use fallback"
- No actual API call to OpenAI

### **Solution**:
**YOU MUST ADD THIS IN VERCEL DASHBOARD**:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: architect-ai-platform
3. Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add these variables for **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...your_key_here...
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...your_key_here...
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=...your_key_here...
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...your_key_here...
REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=...your_key_here...
```

5. **IMPORTANT**: After adding variables, click "Redeploy" to apply them

### **Why Both Keys Are Needed**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Used by serverless functions (`/api/openai-chat`)
- `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` - Used by React frontend services

## Issue 2: Axonometric View Is Inconsistent ❌

### **Problem**:
The axonometric view looks completely different from other 3D views:
- Different materials (yellow in axonometric vs brick in others)
- Different style
- Different proportions
- Not matching Building DNA

### **Why This Happens**:
1. Axonometric view is generated with a generic prompt
2. It doesn't use the detailed Building DNA specification
3. The seed might not be properly applied
4. The prompt doesn't emphasize "EXACT SAME BUILDING" strongly enough

### **Current Axonometric Prompt** (Line 611):
```
Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric view of the SAME ...
```

### **Solution**:
Need to enhance the axonometric prompt to:
1. Use Building DNA materials explicitly
2. Use Building DNA dimensions explicitly
3. Use Building DNA roof type explicitly
4. Use Building DNA window pattern explicitly
5. Emphasize consistency with other views
6. Use same seed as other generations

## Fixes to Implement

### Fix 1: Improve Axonometric Prompt Generation

**File**: `src/services/replicateService.js`
**Line**: ~607-615

**Current**:
```javascript
prompt: `Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric view of the SAME ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription} ${styleContext}, isometric 3D projection from above showing ${entranceDir}-facing entrance clearly visible on ${entranceDir} side, ${unifiedDesc.materials} construction consistent with elevations, ${unifiedDesc.features}, ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floor levels clearly visible with floor separation lines, technical illustration style matching other technical drawings, architectural drawing with clean precise lines, complete roof structure and all building volumes shown, professional architectural visualization, high detail, precise geometry, design must match floor plan layout and elevation facades exactly, unified consistent building design`
```

**Should Be**:
```javascript
// Extract Building DNA for perfect consistency
const buildingDNA = projectContext.buildingDNA || projectContext.masterDesignSpec;
const dnaDetails = buildingDNA ? `
  EXACT specifications from Building DNA:
  - Materials: ${buildingDNA.materials?.exterior || unifiedDesc.materials}
  - Roof: ${buildingDNA.roof?.type || 'gable'} roof with ${buildingDNA.roof?.pitch || 'medium'} pitch
  - Windows: ${buildingDNA.openings?.windows?.type || 'modern'} windows, ${buildingDNA.openings?.windows?.pattern || 'regular'} pattern
  - Dimensions: ${buildingDNA.dimensions?.length || 15}m × ${buildingDNA.dimensions?.width || 10}m × ${buildingDNA.dimensions?.height || 7}m
  - Floors: ${buildingDNA.dimensions?.floorCount || 2} floors
  - Entrance: ${buildingDNA.entranceLocation?.position || entranceDir} side
` : '';

prompt: `Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric technical drawing of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}.
CRITICAL: This must be the EXACT SAME building shown in elevations and floor plans.
${dnaDetails}
Isometric 3D projection from 45-degree angle showing ${entranceDir}-facing entrance on ${entranceDir} side, ${unifiedDesc.materials} construction IDENTICAL to elevations, ${unifiedDesc.features}, ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floor levels with clear floor separation, ${styleContext}, complete roof structure matching elevation views, all building volumes exactly as shown in floor plans, precise geometry, unified consistent design, architectural CAD technical drawing style, clean professional lines, high detail`
```

### Fix 2: Ensure Seed Propagation

**File**: `src/services/replicateService.js`
**Method**: `generateMultipleViews()`

Verify that the seed is being passed to axonometric generation:
```javascript
seed: projectContext.seed || projectContext.projectSeed
```

### Fix 3: Add Building DNA Validation

**File**: `src/services/enhancedAIIntegrationService.js`

Add validation after Building DNA creation to ensure all required fields exist:
```javascript
// Validate Building DNA has all required fields
if (!buildingDNA.materials) {
  buildingDNA.materials = {
    exterior: blendedStyle.materials[0] || 'brick',
    structure: 'concrete frame',
    roof: 'slate tiles'
  };
}
if (!buildingDNA.dimensions) {
  buildingDNA.dimensions = {
    length: 15,
    width: 10,
    height: 7,
    floorCount: 2,
    floors: 2
  };
}
if (!buildingDNA.roof) {
  buildingDNA.roof = {
    type: 'gable',
    pitch: 'medium',
    materials: 'slate tiles'
  };
}
if (!buildingDNA.openings) {
  buildingDNA.openings = {
    windows: {
      type: 'modern',
      pattern: 'regular grid'
    }
  };
}
```

## Testing After Fixes

### Test 1: OpenAI API Key
1. Add environment variables in Vercel
2. Redeploy
3. Upload 5 portfolio images
4. Check browser console (F12)
5. Should see: "✅ Portfolio Analysis Complete" with real data
6. Should NOT see: "using fallback portfolio analysis"

### Test 2: Axonometric Consistency
1. Generate design with Birmingham UK address
2. Check all 3D views (Exterior Front, Exterior Side, Axonometric, Perspective)
3. Verify axonometric matches:
   - Same brick color/material
   - Same roof type
   - Same window pattern
   - Same proportions
   - Same style

### Expected Result:
All views should look like variations of the SAME building, with the axonometric showing the exact same building from a 45-degree top-down angle.
