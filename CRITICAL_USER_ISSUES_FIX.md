## üî¥ Three Critical Issues Reported by User

### **Issue 1: Detached House Generating as Apartment Building** ‚ùå

**User Report**: "i choose detached house but the floor plans generated is not a house and very bigger than surface giving."

**Evidence from Screenshot**:
- User selected "detached house"
- Generated: 5+ story apartment building with massive floor plans
- Floor plans show huge multi-unit layout, not a single-family house

**Root Cause Analysis** ([replicateService.js:454-468](src/services/replicateService.js#L454-L468)):
```javascript
calculateFloorCount(projectContext) {
  const area = projectContext.floorArea || 200;
  const buildingType = projectContext.buildingProgram || 'house';

  // Single-story buildings
  if (buildingType.includes('cottage') || buildingType.includes('bungalow')) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Multi-story based on area - NO BUILDING TYPE CHECK! ‚ùå
  if (area < 150) return 1;
  if (area < 300) return 2;
  if (area < 500) return 3;
  return Math.min(Math.ceil(area / 200), 5); // Max 5 floors
}
```

**Problems**:
1. NO check for "house", "detached house", "villa", "single-family" building types
2. Formula `Math.ceil(area / 200)` creates 5+ floors for large houses
3. Example: 600m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí `Math.ceil(600/200) = 3` floors ‚ùå Could be OK
4. Example: 1000m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí `Math.ceil(1000/200) = 5` floors ‚ùå Creates apartment building!
5. Large houses (200-300m¬≤ per floor) should be 2-3 floors MAX, not 5+

**Expected Behavior**:
- Detached house: MAX 2-3 floors
- Villa: MAX 2-3 floors
- Single-family house: MAX 2-3 floors
- Apartment building: 3-5+ floors allowed
- Office building: 3-5+ floors allowed

---

### **Issue 2: Floor Plan Area NOT Matching User Input** ‚ùå

**User Report**: "floor plans generated is... very bigger than surface giving"

**Evidence from Screenshot**:
- User likely input ~200m¬≤ area
- Floor plan shows MASSIVE multi-room layout suggesting 500-1000m¬≤ total area
- Ground floor alone appears 300-400m¬≤
- Upper floors add even more area

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The `calculateFloorCount()` method creates TOO MANY FLOORS, multiplying the perceived total area.

**Example Calculation**:
```javascript
User Input: 200m¬≤ total area

Current System (BROKEN):
- calculateFloorCount(200) = 1 floor (OK for 200m¬≤)
- BUT prompt says: "200m¬≤ total area"
- AI interprets: 200m¬≤ PER FLOOR
- Result: 1 floor √ó 200m¬≤ = 200m¬≤ ‚úÖ (Actually OK for 200m¬≤)

User Input: 500m¬≤ total area

Current System (BROKEN):
- calculateFloorCount(500) = 3 floors
- Prompt says: "500m¬≤ total area"
- AI interprets TWO WAYS:
  - Option A: 500m¬≤ TOTAL across 3 floors = 167m¬≤ per floor ‚ùå TOO SMALL
  - Option B: 500m¬≤ PER FLOOR √ó 3 = 1500m¬≤ total ‚ùå TOO BIG
- Result: Inconsistent and WRONG
```

**The Real Problem**:
The prompt is AMBIGUOUS. It should specify:
- **Total area**: 500m¬≤
- **Footprint per floor**: 500m¬≤ / 3 floors = 167m¬≤
- OR better: **Total area 500m¬≤, distributed across 3 floors, approximately 167m¬≤ per floor**

---

### **Issue 3: Axonometric STILL Irrelevant to Other 3D Views** ‚ùå

**User Report**: "always axonometric is irrelevent to other 3d views"

**Evidence from Screenshot**:
- Exterior Front View: Brick terraced house with gable roof
- Exterior Side View: Brick terraced house with gable roof
- Axonometric: Modern glass/white cube building - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

**Previous Fix Didn't Work**:
We added comprehensive DNA extraction and consistency rules in commit 5375841, but axonometric is STILL showing wrong building.

**Root Cause Analysis** ([replicateService.js:448-474](src/services/replicateService.js#L448-L474)):
```javascript
case 'axonometric':
  // Extract Building DNA for perfect consistency
  const buildingDNAAxo = projectContext.buildingDNA || projectContext.masterDesignSpec || {};
  const dnaMaterials = buildingDNAAxo.materials?.exterior || unifiedDesc.materials;
  // ...
```

**The Problem**:
1. DNA extraction works
2. BUT the `unifiedDesc.materials` fallback is TOO GENERIC: "brick and glass"
3. AI interprets generic "brick and glass" as MODERN STYLE
4. Axonometric prompt includes: "isometric 3D projection from 45-degree angle showing complete building volume, floor separation lines visible at each level, technical illustration with architectural precision, clean professional CAD-style lines"
5. "technical illustration" + "CAD-style lines" + "45-degree" ‚Üí AI generates TECHNICAL/MODERN style
6. This overrides the brick material specification

**Specific Issue in Prompt** (line 470):
```javascript
prompt: `Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric technical drawing view of the EXACT SAME BUILDING from floor plans and elevations. CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS: Building dimensions EXACTLY ${dnaLength}m √ó ${dnaWidth}m √ó ${dnaHeight}m, ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floors, ${entranceDir}-facing entrance on ${entranceDir} side, EXACT materials: ${dnaMaterials} construction IDENTICAL to elevation drawings, roof type: ${dnaRoof} EXACTLY as shown in elevations, windows: ${dnaWindows} EXACTLY matching elevation pattern, ${unifiedDesc.features}, ${styleContext}, isometric 3D projection from 45-degree angle showing complete building volume, floor separation lines visible at each level, technical illustration with architectural precision, clean professional CAD-style lines, MUST USE IDENTICAL MATERIALS AND COLORS as other 3D views (Exterior Front and Side views), same brick/material texture and color palette, unified consistent architectural design, this is the SAME building shown in all other views just from a different angle, high detail precise geometry matching floor plan footprint and elevation facades exactly`
```

**The Conflict**:
- Early in prompt: "EXACT materials: ${dnaMaterials} construction IDENTICAL to elevation drawings"
- Later in prompt: "technical illustration with architectural precision, clean professional CAD-style lines"
- AI prioritizes "technical illustration" + "CAD-style" ‚Üí generates modern/technical style
- Brick specification gets overridden

---

### **Issue 4: Technical Drawings Irrelevant to 2D/3D Project** ‚ùå

**User Report**: "always technical drawing also irrelevent to 2D and 3D project generated"

**Evidence from Screenshot**:
- 3D Views: Brick terraced house with residential character
- Elevations (North, South, East, West): Classical white stone facade with ornate details - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUILDING!
- Sections: Classical building with formal proportions - NOT matching the brick house

**Root Cause**:
The elevation and section prompts use comprehensive DNA (we just added this), but the DNA likely contains:
1. Generic fallback values when OpenAI API not configured
2. OR the DNA generator creates traditional/classical specifications
3. OR the negative prompts aren't strong enough to prevent classical style

**Analysis of Elevation Prompt** (line 703):
```javascript
prompt: `MAXIMUM QUALITY professional CAD architectural elevation drawing, ${direction} ${elevationType} technical blueprint of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}, STRICTLY FLAT 2D FACADE VIEW ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION, CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT: ${consistencyRule}, ULTRA-PRECISE CAD-QUALITY TECHNICAL DRAWING showing: ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floor levels stacked vertically with clear floor division lines at ${floorHeight}m intervals, EXACT MATERIALS: ${specificMaterials} facade construction IDENTICAL to 3D views and other elevations, materials shown with professional architectural hatching patterns and textures indicating ${materialPrimary} (${materialColor}) with ${materialTexture}...`
```

**The Problem**:
- "professional CAD architectural elevation drawing"
- "technical blueprint"
- "ULTRA-PRECISE CAD-QUALITY TECHNICAL DRAWING"
- "professional architectural hatching patterns"

These terms trigger AI to generate FORMAL/CLASSICAL/TRADITIONAL architectural drawings, which often defaults to classical white stone facades with ornate details.

## üéØ Comprehensive Fix Strategy

### **Fix 1: Enforce Building Type Constraints in calculateFloorCount()** ‚úÖ

**Change**: [replicateService.js:454-468](src/services/replicateService.js#L454-L468)

**New Logic**:
```javascript
calculateFloorCount(projectContext) {
  const area = projectContext.floorArea || 200;
  const buildingType = (projectContext.buildingProgram || 'house').toLowerCase();

  // Single-story buildings
  if (buildingType.includes('cottage') || buildingType.includes('bungalow')) {
    return 1;
  }

  // CRITICAL: Enforce house/villa constraints (NEW)
  const isSingleFamilyHouse =
    buildingType.includes('house') ||
    buildingType.includes('villa') ||
    buildingType.includes('detached') ||
    buildingType.includes('single-family') ||
    buildingType.includes('residential house');

  if (isSingleFamilyHouse) {
    // Single-family houses: MAX 2-3 floors based on area
    if (area < 150) return 1;  // Small house: 1 floor
    if (area < 350) return 2;  // Medium house: 2 floors
    return 2;  // Large house: STILL 2 floors (never create apartment building!)
    // NOTE: User can override by selecting "villa" which allows 3 floors
  }

  // Multi-unit buildings (apartments, offices): 3-5+ floors allowed
  if (area < 150) return 1;
  if (area < 300) return 2;
  if (area < 500) return 3;
  return Math.min(Math.ceil(area / 200), 5); // Max 5 floors
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- 200m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (100m¬≤ per floor) ‚úÖ
- 500m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (250m¬≤ per floor) ‚úÖ NOT 3 floors
- 1000m¬≤ detached house ‚Üí 2 floors (500m¬≤ per floor) ‚úÖ NOT 5 floors
- 500m¬≤ apartment building ‚Üí 3 floors ‚úÖ
- 1000m¬≤ apartment building ‚Üí 5 floors ‚úÖ

### **Fix 2: Clarify Floor Plan Area in Prompt** ‚úÖ

**Change**: [replicateService.js:616-651](src/services/replicateService.js#L616-L651)

**New Prompt Logic**:
```javascript
buildFloorPlanParameters(projectContext, level = 'ground') {
  const unifiedDesc = this.createUnifiedBuildingDescription(projectContext);

  // Calculate footprint area per floor
  const totalArea = unifiedDesc.floorArea;
  const floorCount = unifiedDesc.floorCount;
  const footprintArea = Math.round(totalArea / floorCount);

  // Update prompt to be EXPLICIT about area per floor
  return {
    prompt: `MAXIMUM QUALITY professional CAD architectural floor plan drawing, ${level} floor technical blueprint for ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}, ${levelDesc}, ${entranceNote} BUILDING FOOTPRINT ${footprintArea}m¬≤ THIS FLOOR ONLY (total building ${totalArea}m¬≤ across ${floorCount} floors), ULTRA-PRECISE BLACK AND WHITE CAD-QUALITY TECHNICAL DRAWING...`
  };
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Calculate `footprintArea = totalArea / floorCount`
- Specify: "BUILDING FOOTPRINT ${footprintArea}m¬≤ THIS FLOOR ONLY"
- Clarify: "(total building ${totalArea}m¬≤ across ${floorCount} floors)"

**Expected Results**:
- 200m¬≤ detached house, 2 floors ‚Üí "100m¬≤ THIS FLOOR ONLY (total 200m¬≤ across 2 floors)" ‚úÖ
- AI generates appropriately-sized floor plan
- No more massive 500m¬≤ floor plans when user requested 200m¬≤ total

---

### **Fix 3: Strengthen Axonometric Consistency** ‚úÖ

**Change**: [replicateService.js:448-474](src/services/replicateService.js#L448-L474)

**Strategy**:
1. Extract MORE DETAILED material specs from DNA
2. Move material specification EARLIER in prompt (higher priority)
3. Remove/reduce "technical illustration" wording that triggers modern style
4. Add stronger PHOTOREALISTIC emphasis
5. Add negative prompt to prevent modern/glass building

**New Prompt Logic**:
```javascript
case 'axonometric':
  // Extract Building DNA with MORE DETAIL
  const buildingDNAAxo = projectContext.buildingDNA || projectContext.masterDesignSpec || {};

  // Get EXACT material specifications (not just name)
  const dnaMaterials = buildingDNAAxo.materials?.exterior || {};
  const materialPrimary = dnaMaterials.primary || unifiedDesc.materials;
  const materialColor = dnaMaterials.color || 'natural brick red';  // More specific fallback
  const materialTexture = dnaMaterials.texture || 'textured brick with mortar joints';  // Specific
  const materialFull = `${materialPrimary} (${materialColor}) with ${materialTexture}`;

  return {
    prompt: `Professional architectural axonometric 45-degree isometric view of the EXACT SAME ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription} from floor plans and elevations. CRITICAL MATERIAL CONSISTENCY: Building constructed with ${materialFull}, IDENTICAL materials and colors to Exterior Front and Side views. Building dimensions ${dnaLength}m √ó ${dnaWidth}m √ó ${dnaHeight}m, ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floors, ${entranceDir}-facing entrance, roof: ${dnaRoof}, windows: ${dnaWindows}. Photorealistic rendering with EXACT brick/material texture and color matching other 3D views, isometric 3D projection from 45-degree angle showing complete building volume, floor separation lines at each level, architectural precision showing SAME building from different angle, unified consistent design, realistic materials not simplified technical style`,

    negativePrompt: "modern glass building, white cube, contemporary minimalist, technical diagram, simplified CAD style, different materials from other views, different colors, wrong building type, yellow walls, wrong material color"
  };
}
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Extract full material specs: primary + color + texture
2. Lead with "CRITICAL MATERIAL CONSISTENCY" (first thing AI sees)
3. Specify exact color: "warm red-brown" not just "red"
4. Add "Photorealistic rendering" to counter "technical" interpretation
5. Change "technical illustration" ‚Üí "architectural precision"
6. Add strong negative prompt against modern/glass/white cube

---

### **Fix 4: Make Elevations/Sections Match Architectural Style** ‚úÖ

**Change**: [replicateService.js:657-715](src/services/replicateService.js#L657-L715)

**Strategy**:
1. Extract architectural style from blendedStyle/DNA
2. If style is "traditional", "Georgian", "Victorian" ‚Üí Use appropriate classical details
3. If style is "contemporary", "modern" ‚Üí Use clean lines
4. Add style-specific negative prompts
5. Emphasize MATCHING the 3D views' architectural character

**New Logic**:
```javascript
buildElevationParameters(projectContext, direction = 'north') {
  const unifiedDesc = this.createUnifiedBuildingDescription(projectContext);
  const buildingDNA = projectContext.buildingDNA || {};

  // Get architectural style to match
  const archStyle = projectContext.architecturalStyle || unifiedDesc.architecturalStyle || 'contemporary';
  const isTraditional = archStyle.toLowerCase().includes('traditional') ||
                        archStyle.toLowerCase().includes('victorian') ||
                        archStyle.toLowerCase().includes('georgian');

  // Build style-specific description
  const styleEmphasis = isTraditional
    ? `traditional ${archStyle} architectural style with brick facade, symmetrical composition, classic proportions`
    : `${archStyle} architectural style with ${materialPrimary} facade matching 3D visualizations`;

  // Add style-specific negative prompts
  const styleNegativePrompt = isTraditional
    ? "modern glass facade, contemporary minimalist, flat roof, incorrect classical style"
    : "classical ornate details, traditional ornaments, incorrect modern style, wrong contemporary design";

  return {
    prompt: `MAXIMUM QUALITY professional CAD architectural elevation drawing, ${direction} elevation of ${unifiedDesc.fullDescription}, ${styleEmphasis}, EXACT MATERIALS: ${specificMaterials} facade IDENTICAL to 3D views, technical drawing showing ${unifiedDesc.floorCount} floors, ${roofSpec}, ${windowSpec}...`,

    negativePrompt: `...existing negatives..., ${styleNegativePrompt}, completely different building style from 3D views`
  };
}
```
