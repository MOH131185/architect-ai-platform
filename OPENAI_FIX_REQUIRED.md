# CRITICAL: OpenAI API Key Configuration Required

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKING ISSUE - OpenAI not working in production
**Impact:** Design consistency completely broken

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE

Your OpenAI API is returning **401 Unauthorized** errors because the API key is **NOT configured in Vercel**.

### Console Errors:
```
/api/openai-chat:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
Portfolio style detection error: Error: OpenAI API error: 401
OpenAI API error: Error: OpenAI API error: 401
Structural notes generation error: Error: OpenAI API error: 401
MEP notes generation error: Error: OpenAI API error: 401
```

### Impact:
Without OpenAI working, the entire **unified reasoning framework** fails, causing:
- ‚ùå 2D floor plans don't match 3D views
- ‚ùå Elevations don't match floor plans
- ‚ùå Interior views don't match building program
- ‚ùå Each view generates independently with NO consistency
- ‚ùå No portfolio style detection
- ‚ùå No design reasoning or philosophy
- ‚ùå No structural/MEP engineering notes

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Configure OpenAI API Key in Vercel

You MUST add the OpenAI API key to your Vercel project's environment variables.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Navigate to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select your project: **architect-ai-platform**

#### 2. Open Environment Variables
- Click on **Settings** tab
- Click on **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

#### 3. Add OpenAI API Key
Click **Add New** and enter:

**Name:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Value:** (Use your actual OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
```
sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace with your REAL key from the OpenAI dashboard.

**IMPORTANT:** Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (without `REACT_APP_` prefix) because it's used by the serverless function.

#### 4. Select Environments
Check ALL three boxes:
- ‚úÖ **Production**
- ‚úÖ **Preview**
- ‚úÖ **Development**

#### 5. Click "Save"

#### 6. Redeploy
After saving, you MUST trigger a new deployment:
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click the **‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢** menu on the latest deployment
- Click **Redeploy**
- Check **"Use existing Build Cache"** (optional)
- Click **Redeploy**

## üîê ALSO ADD (While You're There):

While configuring environment variables, make sure ALL API keys are present:

### 1. Google Maps API Key
```
Name: REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
Value: (Your Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console)
```

### 2. OpenWeather API Key
```
Name: REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
Value: (Your OpenWeather API key from openweathermap.org)
```

### 3. Replicate API Key
```
Name: REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY
Value: (Your Replicate API key from replicate.com)
```

### 4. Replicate API Key (Serverless)
```
Name: REPLICATE_API_KEY
Value: (Same Replicate API key, but without REACT_APP_ prefix)
```

## üìã HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING

After redeploying with the OpenAI API key configured:

### 1. Check Browser Console (Before Generation)
Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Console, then start a new design generation.

### 2. Look For Success Messages
You should see:
```
‚úÖ Portfolio style detected: Contemporary
‚úÖ Unified design framework created from OpenAI reasoning
‚úÖ Photorealistic 3D views generated with unified design framework
```

### 3. Check for NO 401 Errors
You should NOT see:
```
‚ùå /api/openai-chat:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401
```

### 4. Verify Consistency
After generation completes:
- Open floor plan - Note the room layout
- Open 3D exterior view - Should match floor plan footprint
- Open 3D interior view - Should show rooms from floor plan
- Open elevations - Should match building height and style from 3D views

If they all match = OpenAI reasoning is working ‚úÖ

## üîß TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

### Why This Happens

**Local Development (.env file):**
```javascript
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  // Works locally
```

**Production (Vercel serverless function):**
```javascript
// api/openai-chat.js looks for:
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY;

// If OPENAI_API_KEY is not set in Vercel ‚Üí returns undefined ‚Üí 401 error
```

### The Fix

The serverless function `api/openai-chat.js` needs **OPENAI_API_KEY** (no prefix) set in Vercel environment variables.

**File:** `api/openai-chat.js` (lines 45-46)
```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

Once OpenAI API key is configured and redeployed:

### OpenAI Will Generate:

1. **Portfolio Style Detection**
   - Analyzes uploaded portfolio images
   - Extracts materials, proportions, color palette
   - Detects architectural style characteristics

2. **Unified Architectural Prompt**
   - Creates single source of truth for the design
   - Includes: philosophy, spatial organization, materials, sustainability
   - Applied to ALL views (2D, 3D, technical drawings)

3. **Design Reasoning**
   - Philosophy: Why this design approach
   - Spatial Organization: How spaces relate
   - Material Recommendations: What materials and why
   - Environmental Strategy: Climate response

4. **Engineering Notes**
   - Structural calculations and specifications
   - MEP system requirements and sizing
   - Code compliance notes

### Design Consistency Will Improve:

- ‚úÖ 2D floor plans use same room program as 3D views
- ‚úÖ Elevations match floor plan dimensions
- ‚úÖ 3D views reference same materials and style
- ‚úÖ Interior views show rooms from floor plan
- ‚úÖ All views describe the SAME building

## üìä COST CONSIDERATIONS

Once OpenAI starts working, you'll see usage in your OpenAI billing dashboard.

**Expected Cost Per Design:**
- Design Reasoning: ~2,000 tokens = $0.03
- Portfolio Analysis: ~1,500 tokens = $0.02
- Structural Notes: ~1,000 tokens = $0.015
- MEP Notes: ~1,000 tokens = $0.015
- **Total: ~$0.08 per complete design**

This is MUCH cheaper than the issue you're having now (inconsistent designs that users can't use).

## üîç DEBUGGING STEPS

If you still see 401 errors after configuring:

### 1. Verify Environment Variable is Set
In Vercel dashboard:
- Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Look for `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Should show "Production, Preview, Development"

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
- Deployments ‚Üí Latest deployment
- Click "View Function Logs"
- Look for "OpenAI API key not configured" messages

### 3. Test the Serverless Function Directly
Visit in browser (will fail with 405 but shows it's running):
```
https://www.archiaisolution.pro/api/openai-chat
```

Should show: `{"error":"Method not allowed"}` (not 401)

### 4. Verify API Key is Valid
Test your OpenAI API key directly:
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-svcacct-..." \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'
```

Should return a chat response, not 401.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### DO NOT Commit API Keys to Git

Your `.env` file should already be in `.gitignore`. **Never** commit API keys to your repository.

### Current .env File Security

I notice your `.env` file contains real API keys. Make sure:
1. `.env` is in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
2. Never commit `.env` to GitHub ‚úÖ
3. Only set keys in Vercel dashboard for production ‚úÖ

### API Key Rotation

If you suspect your OpenAI API key has been compromised:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Delete the old key
3. Create a new key
4. Update in both `.env` (local) and Vercel (production)

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. ‚úÖ Go to Vercel dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. ‚úÖ Set value to your OpenAI API key
4. ‚úÖ Select all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)
5. ‚úÖ Click Save
6. ‚úÖ Redeploy the application
7. ‚úÖ Test a new design generation
8. ‚úÖ Verify no 401 errors in console
9. ‚úÖ Verify design consistency across 2D/3D views

**This is critical for design consistency to work!**

---

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION IN VERCEL DASHBOARD
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocking core functionality
**Est. Time to Fix:** 5 minutes (manual configuration)

Once completed, the unified reasoning framework will work and designs will be consistent across all views.
