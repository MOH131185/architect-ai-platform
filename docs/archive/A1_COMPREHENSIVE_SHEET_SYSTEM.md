## =' How to Modify the A1 Sheet with Text Prompts

After generating the A1 sheet, the **AI Modification Panel** appears automatically.

### Tab 1: Add Missing Views

If any views are missing, click on them to generate:
- Ground Floor Plan
- Upper Floor Plan
- North/South/East/West Elevations
- Longitudinal/Transverse Sections
- Exterior/Axonometric/Site/Interior 3D Views

**Example**:
```
1. A1 sheet generated (missing interior 3D view)
2. Modification panel shows "Interior View" in missing views
3. Click "Interior View" button
4. AI generates photorealistic interior using same DNA
5. View added to project (available separately)
```

### Tab 2: Modify A1 Sheet

Enter natural language instructions to modify the entire A1 sheet:

**Example Modifications**:

```
Make the entrance more prominent with a covered porch,
add balconies to the upper floor bedrooms,
change the brick color to light grey
```

```
Add solar panels to the roof,
increase window sizes on the south facade,
add a double garage on the east side
```

```
Change architectural style to Victorian,
use red brick with white trim,
add bay windows on ground floor
```

**What Happens**:
1. AI reads your modification request
2. Retrieves original DNA (dimensions, materials, style)
3. Updates DNA with your requested changes
4. Regenerates ENTIRE A1 sheet with modifications
5. Maintains consistency (same seed, same base design)
6. Original dimensions preserved unless explicitly changed

### Tab 3: History

- View all modifications made
- See timestamps and status
- Preview generated images
- Review user prompts
- Check for errors

##  Consistency Enforcement

### Absolute Consistency Across ALL Views

**Building Dimensions**:
- EXACTLY the same length, width, height in ALL views
- Floor plans ’ Elevations ’ Sections ’ 3D views
- Zero tolerance for variations

**Materials**:
- EXACT hex colors used throughout
- Facade material: Same in plans, elevations, 3D
- Roof material: Same in all roof views
- NO color variations between views

**Window Positions**:
- IDENTICAL placement across floor plans and elevations
- Every window on plan appears on corresponding elevation
- Same dimensions and spacing

**Floor Heights**:
- CONSISTENT floor-to-floor heights
- Plans ’ Sections ’ 3D views all match
- Level markers aligned

**Cross-View Checklist**:
-  Floor Plans ’ Elevations: Window positions match EXACTLY
-  Floor Plans ’ Sections: Room dimensions match EXACTLY
-  Elevations ’ 3D Views: Facade features match EXACTLY
-  Sections ’ 3D Views: Ceiling heights match EXACTLY
-  Axonometric ’ Perspective: Same geometry, different angles
-  Site Plan ’ All Views: Footprint matches EXACTLY

### Step 4: Modify if Needed

**AI Modification Panel appears automatically**

**Option A: Add Missing Individual Views**
- Click on any missing view
- AI generates it with same DNA
- Available as separate image

**Option B: Modify Entire A1 Sheet**
- Enter modification text
- Click "Generate Modified A1 Sheet"
- Wait 30-40 seconds
- New A1 sheet with changes appears
- Original DNA maintained for consistency

### Step 5: Export and Use

**Download Options**:
- A1 Sheet (PNG/JPG) - For printing or digital presentation
- Individual views - If you generated them separately
- DWG/RVT/IFC - For CAD/BIM software
- PDF - Complete project documentation
