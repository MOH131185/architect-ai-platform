## Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
The following API keys are already configured in `.env`:

```env
# OpenAI API for Design Reasoning
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Replicate API for Image Generation
REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key_here
```

> **Note:** Your actual API keys are already configured in your local `.env` file. Do NOT commit the `.env` file to GitHub.

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## AI Services Architecture

### OpenAI Service (`src/services/openaiService.js`)
- **Design Reasoning**: Comprehensive architectural analysis
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Project viability assessment
- **Style Variations**: Different design approaches
- **Fallback Support**: Works without API when needed

### Replicate Service (`src/services/replicateService.js`)
- **SDXL Multi-ControlNet LoRA**: Advanced architectural visualization
- **Multiple Views**: Exterior, interior, site plan, sections
- **Style Variations**: Different architectural approaches
- **ControlNet Integration**: Precise architectural control
- **Fallback Images**: Placeholder images when API unavailable

- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinates OpenAI and Replicate
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error management

## API Integration Details

### OpenAI Integration
- **Model**: GPT-4 for advanced reasoning
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for creative but consistent responses
- **Max Tokens**: 2000 for comprehensive analysis
- **System Prompt**: Expert architectural AI assistant
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to predefined responses

### Replicate Integration
- **Model**: SDXL with Multi-ControlNet LoRA
- **Resolution**: 1024x768 for architectural views
- **Steps**: 50-60 for quality generation
- **Guidance Scale**: 7.5-8.0 for architectural precision
- **ControlNet**: Architectural element control
- **Error Handling**: Placeholder images when unavailable

## Fallback Behavior

When APIs are unavailable, the system provides:
- **Design Reasoning**: Predefined architectural principles
- **Visualizations**: Placeholder images with appropriate labels
- **Analysis**: Basic feasibility and recommendations
- **User Experience**: Clear indication of fallback mode

## Development Notes

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openaiService.js          # OpenAI integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ replicateService.js        # Replicate integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ aiIntegrationService.js    # Service orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AIMVP.js                  # MVP interface
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AIMVP.css                 # MVP styling
â””â”€â”€ App.js                        # Main application
```

### Error Handling
- API failures gracefully fall back to predefined responses
- Network issues show appropriate error messages
- Missing API keys trigger fallback mode
- User feedback for all states (loading, success, error, fallback)

### Performance
- Parallel API calls where possible
- Efficient state management
- Responsive UI with loading states
- Optimized image handling

## Testing Your Fine-Tuned Models

When your custom models are ready:

1. **Replace OpenAI Service**: Update `openaiService.js` to use your reasoning model
2. **Replace Replicate Service**: Update `replicateService.js` to use your generation model
3. **Update Integration**: Modify `aiIntegrationService.js` for new model endpoints
4. **Test Workflow**: Use the MVP interface to test your models

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Setup**: Verify APIs are working with the MVP
2. **Fine-Tune Models**: Develop your custom reasoning and generation models
3. **Replace Services**: Update services to use your models
4. **Enhance UI**: Improve the interface based on your model capabilities
5. **Production Ready**: Scale and optimize for production use

## Support

- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env`
- Test with simple project contexts first
- Monitor API usage and quotas
- Check network connectivity for API calls

This MVP provides a solid foundation for testing AI-powered architectural design while you develop your custom models!
